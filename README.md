### NAE.json

To configure NAE application more easily the libraries use file nae.json that is placed in root of the project.
nae.json defines global application configuration like urls to backend resources, services' configurations, routing and views.

You can find [minimal nae.json configuration here](docs/configuration/nae-minimal.json).

You can read more on how to configure complete [nae.json here](https://components.netgrif.com/configuration).
