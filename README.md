# Netgrif Application Engine Backend Starter

This is a frontend starter project for [Netgrif Application Engine](https://github.com/netgrif/components) to display your NAE based application, manage your processes, cases and tasks.

It helps if you are familiar with Angular Framework, Typescript, CSS and HTML, but it is not necessary as this starter project already contains some predefined views and navigation items, which are suitable for interacting with your processes.

### NAE.json

To configure NAE application more easily the libraries use file nae.json that is placed in root of the project.
nae.json defines global application configuration like urls to backend resources, services' configurations, routing and views.

You can find [minimal nae.json configuration here](docs/configuration/nae-minimal.json).

You can read more on how to configure complete [nae.json here](https://components.netgrif.com/configuration).
